What problems did this solve in the company?
- The first order problem that this spreadsheet solves is an easy to use platform for our two branch stores to order inventory from the primary store and warehouse. This was an alternative to the previous method of handwriting and then using a fax machine.
- Allowed our company to begin tracking inventory. Before the implementation of this spreadsheet, inventory stock levels in our accounting software were ignored. 
- A search page allows all of the users to check inventory across each location and then place specific items on order or put them on a count sheet. A count log is kept so that items which have been counted recently have a date associated with them, used as an indicator to the user that the inventory value is more likely to be accurate.
- Barcodes are also stored on the spreadsheet and therefore allow users to scan items directly onto the order page or do manual inventory by scan packages and then typing the corresponding inventory quantity.
